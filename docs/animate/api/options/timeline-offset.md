### timelineOffset

| Default | Type             |
| :------ | :--------------- |
| `0`     | Number \| String |

Adds an offset amount to the `delay` option, for creating a timeline similar to `animejs`.

I don't intend to create a `timeline` function for this library but if you wish to please try your hands at creating one, if it's small, light-weight, and there is a need I might incorperate it.
