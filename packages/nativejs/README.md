A framework to enable PJAX (Page AJAX) in web pages without the fluff of complex libraries. It was inspired by Rezo Zero's Starting Blocks project, and Barba.js. Both libraries had a major impact on the developement of this project. Barba.js is easy to use and applies PJAX on a site with ease, while Starting Blocks, allow's for granular control and cool effects that makes websites more app like. 


This project is called a framework but it is more like a guideline, if all you want is a simple starter project that has PJAX built in then you install the project from npm once it becomes availavle, but otherwse you download the project into you workspace and tweak it to match your project and remove all the extra fluff you don't want (By the way, this project works best with treeshaking, so, for the sake of speed, performance, and weight use Rollup or Webpack; Rollup is prefered).
