A framework who's goal is to make it easier to create complex, performant, light-weight, web applications using native js apis. It was inspired by Rezo Zero's Starting Blocks project, and Barba.js. Both libraries had a major impact on the development of this project. Barba.js is easy to use and elevates the experience of a site with the use of PJAX, while Starting Blocks used native apis to create light-weight but complex web experiences. This project exists as a more flexible alternative to Starting Blocks, but with the same intuitive design and experience (UX/DX) Barba.js provides. It also, allows for web apps to be created without the need of PJAX, and safely switches back to normal HTML controls if JS is disabled.

This project is called a framework but it is more like a guideline, if all you want is a simple starter project that has PJAX built in then you install the project from `npm` once it becomes available, but otherwise you download the project into you workspace and tweak it to match your projects needs and remove all the extra fluff you don't want (By the way, this project works best with treeshaking, so, for the sake of speed, performance, and weight use Rollup or Webpack; Rollup is preferred).
